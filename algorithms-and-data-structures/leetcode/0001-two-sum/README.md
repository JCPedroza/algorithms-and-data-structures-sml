# Two Sum

Given a `list` of `integer`s *nums* and an `integer` *target*, return the
indexes of the two numbers that add add up to target, as a `tuple` pair.

You cannot use the same element twice. If no solution is found, return (~1, ~1).

The indexes in the answer must be in ascending order.

## Function Signature

```sml
val twoSum : int -> int list -> int * int
```

## Examples

```text
in: target = 12, nums = [11, 3, 9, 15]
out: (1, 2)

in: target = 6, nums = [2, 4, 3]
out: (0, 1)

in: target = ~16, nums = [5, 6, ~8, 13, ~8]
out: (2, 4)

in: target = 0, nums = [1]
out: (~1, ~1)
```

## Constraints

```text
0 <= length of nums list <= 104
-100 <= number value <= 100
-100 <= target value <= 100
There's either one solution or no solution.
```

## Extra

Find a solution with time complexity below `O(nÂ²)`.
