# SML Algorithms and Data Structures

Algorithms and data structures implemented in Standard ML.

The purpose of this repository is for us to practice:

- Standard ML in general
- Functional and functional-first programming
- Algorithms
- Data structures
- Unit testing
- Version control
- Code collaboration

## SML Implementations

- [Poly/ML][30]
- [MLton][31]
- [SML/NJ][32]
- [Moscow ML][33]

## Style and Conventions

- [Naming conventions][50]
- [Style guide][51]

## Unit Tests

### Poly/ML

Inside the test file's directory:

```bash
poly -q --use <test-file>.sml
```
